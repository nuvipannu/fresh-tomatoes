# Fresh Tomatoes!

This web page displays a list of my favorite movies with their poster images and movie trailers.
This is the first project in <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004">Udacityâ€™s Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree</a> and focuses on writing server-side code to store a list of movies (in a Python class object).


<h1>How to use</h1>

Inside the project directory, run the movies.py file. This file will execute all necessary codes and creates (or overwrites) a index.html file. The index.html file will be automatically opened in your web browser.
